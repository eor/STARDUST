# STARDUST
Spectrum Transport Around RaDiating Universal Source Type

A cosmological 1D radiative transfer code, which is primarily based on [1], [2],[3], and [n]. An earlier version was first indrocuced in [n+1]

Rational:


## Installation
Software dependencies: 

* C/C++ compiler
* GNU Scientific library (GSL)
* ODEint (part of Boost) 
* libconfig



## Generating Spectral Energy Distribution files

...

## Example runs 


To run STARDUST you will need a SED file and a configuration file. A sample configuration files can be found with the source code or in the *tests* directory. A simulation can be started like this
```bash
user@machine:~/SD_project/$ ./STARDUST my_SD_config 
```
